### AI for ecosystem modelling {#ai}
I build collaborative intelligence workflows coupling large language models and evolutionary optimisation to discover interpretable mechanistic models, automate diet matrix construction, and accelerate marine ecosystem model development.  
See **bioRxiv** preprint on LLM‑discovered models and **Environmental Evidence** paper on generative‑AI qualitative extraction (links on the Publications page).

### Seaweed farming & sustainability {#seaweed}
Global analysis of seaweed products substituting food, feed, and fuels; quantifying land‑use, emissions, and biodiversity implications of large‑scale ocean farming.

### Decision‑support & evidence synthesis {#decision}
Human–AI pipelines to prioritise literature, extract qualitative insights, and support stakeholder engagement—linking open data, reproducible workflows, and policy.
